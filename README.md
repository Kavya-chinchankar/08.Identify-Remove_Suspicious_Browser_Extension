# 🛡️ Task 8 – VPN Privacy Protection

## 📘 Title
**Understanding VPNs for Privacy and Secure Communication**

---

## 🎯 Objective
To understand how VPNs protect user privacy, encrypt internet traffic, and prevent online tracking through secure tunneling.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **ProtonVPN (Free Tier)**  
- **WhatIsMyIPAddress.com** – for IP verification  
- **Windows 10**

---

## 🪜 Steps Performed
1. Signed up for **ProtonVPN Free Account**.  
2. Installed and launched the VPN client.  
3. Connected to a VPN server (Netherlands).  
4. Verified IP address change using **whatismyipaddress.com**.  
5. Tested encrypted browsing on various websites.  
6. Disconnected and compared IP and speed differences.

## 📊 Observations
| Test Parameter | Without VPN | With VPN |
|----------------|-------------|-----------|
| IP Address | India | Netherlands |
| Encryption | None | AES-256 Encrypted |
| Speed | Normal | Slightly Slower |
| Privacy | Low | High |

## ✅ Benefits of VPNs
- Masks IP address and hides location.  
- Encrypts all internet traffic.  
- Prevents ISP tracking and monitoring.  
- Provides safe browsing on public networks.  
- Bypasses content restrictions and censorship.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Free versions offer limited servers.  
- Slight decrease in browsing speed.  
- Some VPNs may log metadata or have privacy concerns.  
- Streaming services can detect and block VPN usage.

---

## 🧩 Research Summary
- VPNs use **encryption (AES-256)** and **tunneling protocols** (like OpenVPN or WireGuard) to secure data.  
- They mask your real IP by routing traffic through remote servers.  
- This protects against hackers, surveillance, and data tracking.

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- VPNs play a vital role in **internet privacy** and **data protection**.  
- Encryption ensures **secure communication** between users and servers.  
- IP masking prevents unauthorized location tracking.  
- Regular VPN use enhances security on public Wi-Fi.

---

## 🏁 Outcome
Successfully configured and tested a VPN connection, verified encryption and IP masking, and learned the importance of VPNs in online privacy and security.
