# Task 8 – VPN Privacy Protection 🔐

## 🧭 Objective
To understand the role of **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)** in protecting user privacy, encrypting online traffic, and ensuring secure communication over the internet.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **ProtonVPN (Free Plan)**  
- **WhatIsMyIPAddress.com** – to verify IP address changes  
- **Windows 10** operating system

---

## ⚙️ Steps Performed

### Step 1 – Choose a VPN Service
- Selected **ProtonVPN (Free Tier)** for testing.
- Created a free account using a verified email ID.

### Step 2 – Install and Launch VPN Client
- Downloaded the official ProtonVPN client from [https://protonvpn.com](https://protonvpn.com).  
- Installed and launched the application on Windows 10.

### Step 3 – Connect to a VPN Server
- Logged in using free account credentials.  
- Chose a free VPN server located in **Netherlands**.  
- Clicked **Connect** and waited for the tunnel to establish.

### Step 4 – Verify IP Address
- Visited [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com).  
- Noted the **IP address before and after connection**.

| State | IP Address | Location |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Before VPN | 49.xxx.xx.xx | India |
| After VPN | 185.xxx.xx.xx | Netherlands |

✅ IP successfully changed, confirming traffic routing through the VPN server.

### Step 5 – Test Encrypted Browsing
- Opened several websites (YouTube, Wikipedia, ProtonMail).  
- Confirmed that all traffic was encrypted using **OpenVPN protocol (AES-256 encryption)**.

### Step 6 – Disconnect and Compare
- Disconnected VPN and rechecked the IP → reverted back to original (India).  
- Observed a slight reduction in browsing speed (~10–15%).

## 📊 Observations

| Parameter | Without VPN | With VPN |
|------------|--------------|-----------|
| IP Location | India | Netherlands |
| Encryption | None | AES-256 Encrypted |
| Browsing Speed | Normal | Slightly Slower |
| Privacy Protection | Low | High |

## 🔐 Benefits of Using a VPN
1. **Hides Real IP Address** – Masks your true location and identity online.  
2. **Encrypts Internet Traffic** – Prevents ISPs and hackers from reading your data.  
3. **Enhances Security on Public Wi-Fi** – Protects from man-in-the-middle attacks.  
4. **Bypasses Geo-Restrictions** – Access region-locked content.  
5. **Prevents ISP Tracking** – Stops tracking of browsing habits and metadata.

## ⚠️ Limitations of VPNs
- **Slower Connection Speed** due to encryption overhead.  
- **Limited Server Options** in free plans.  
- **No Absolute Anonymity** – VPN providers may log metadata.  
- **Blocked by Some Websites** (e.g., streaming services).  
- **Trust Factor** – Depends on the VPN provider’s privacy policy.

## 🧩 Research Summary: How VPNs Work
- VPNs create a **secure, encrypted tunnel** between your device and the internet.  
- Data packets are encrypted using protocols like **OpenVPN**, **WireGuard**, or **IKEv2**.  
- Your ISP and attackers cannot see your actual online activity or destination websites.  

**Encryption Example:**  
AES-256-bit encryption → takes billions of years to brute-force.
